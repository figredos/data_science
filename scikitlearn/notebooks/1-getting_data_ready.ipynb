    "\n",
    "Splitting data is a crucial step in any scikit-learn workflow because it helps avoid biased evaluation of a machine learning model. Imagine training a model on all of the available data, then using that same data to measure its performance. The model might appear to do very well on this task, but that's because it's basically memorizing the data it was trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can lead to **overfitting**, where the model performs well on the training data but struggles with new, unseen data. Splitting the data into separate training and test sets ensures the model is evaluated on data it hasn't seen before. This provides a more realistic assessment of the model's ability to generalize to new situations. By training the model on the training set and then testing its performance on the test set, you get a more accurate picture of how well it will perform in real-world scenarios\n",

    "\n",
    "The first one called `OneHotEncoder` object that uses **_One-Hot Encoding_**. One Hot Encoding is a technique used in machine learning to convert categorical variables, like \"shirt size\" (small, medium, large) or \"fruit\" (apple, banana, orange), into a numerical format that scikit-learn models can understand. It does this by creating a new binary feature for each unique category within the original variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each new feature is assigned a value of 1 if the data point belongs to that category and 0 otherwise. This essentially creates a new \"one-hot\" vector for each data point, where only one element is active at a time. This allows scikit-learn models to treat these categorical variables like numerical features and learn the relationships between them and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Column Transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "The second would be a `Column Transformer`. This is a powerful tool, that is a part of scikit-learn, for handling mixed data types in a machine learning workflow. Imagine a dataset containing numerical values like age and income, alongside categorical data like job title or city. Traditional methods might require separate transformations for each data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ColumnTransformer simplifies this process by allowing you to define different transformers for different data subsets. You can specify transformations for numerical columns (like scaling) and categorical columns (like one-hot encoding) within a single transformer object. This streamlines your workflow, keeps your code organized, and ensures each data type is transformed appropriately before feeding it into your machine learning model\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Column Transformer` takes a few parameters, but the most important one would be the transformers. This parameters takes a list of tuples in the following syntax `(name, transformer, columns)`. `name` is a user-defined name for the transformer, it helps identify the purpose of the transformation applied to that specific set of columns. `transformer` is the actual scikit-learn transformer to be applied. such as a `StandardScaler`, numerical scaling, `OneHotEncoder`, or custom defined transformers. `columns` specifies the columns in the data that the transformer should be applied to, this can be a list of column names or their corresponding indexes.\n"

    "Filling missing data is crucial in a scikit-learn workflow because many machine learning algorithms simply cannot handle data with missing values.

Leaving them unaddressed can lead to errors during training or nonsensical results.\n",

By replacing missing values with appropriate estimates (like mean, median, or mode), you ensure the algorithms can process the data effectively and learn the underlying relationships between features,.

    "1. The first step to doing preprocessing in Scikit-learn is to create transformers for the intended data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the entirety of the data should be transformed in one single way, simply create one transformer, otherwise, each type of change should be make by its own transformer. A simple transformer can be created with the `SimpleImputer` class. This class receives a strategy, referring to the strategy of imputing to be used. The strategies can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `mean`, that replaces the values using the mean along each column, only with numeric data\n",
    "- `median`, that replaces the missing values using the median along each column, also only with numerical data\n",
    "- `most_frequent`, that replaces the values with the most frequent one along each column, being able to be used with bot numerical and string values.\n",
    "- `constant`, that replaces missing values with the value inserted in the `fill_value` parameter. This can also be used with both numerical and string values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second step would be to define which columns are to be changed by the transformer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The third step is to use `ColumnTransformer` to apply the transformers to each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Fit the data from the imputer/transformer into the desired output.\n"
