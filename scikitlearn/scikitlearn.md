# Scikit-Learn

Scikit-Learn, or sklearn, is a free and open-source library for machine learning in Python. It shines in tasks that don't necessarily require the power of deep learning. Scikit-Learn provides a user-friendly interface and a broad set of well established machine learning algorithms like support vector machines and decision trees.

This makes it a great choice for beginners or projects that prioritize quick prototyping. It primarily works with tabular data, the kind organized in rows and columns like spreadsheets, and offers some customization options for these algorithms. However, for situations demanding high specialized models or intricate deep learning architectures, scikit-learn might not be the most suitable tool.

## Documentation

[This link](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) contains the entirety of scikit-learn's documentation.

## Scikit-learn workflow

[This file](notebooks/0-scikit-learn_workflow.ipynb) contains a simple workflow for using the tools provided by scikit-learn.

## Getting data ready

[This file](notebooks/1-getting_data_ready.ipynb) contains some of the methods to get data ready for creating models.

## Choosing right model

[This file](notebooks/2-choosing_right_model.ipynb) contains information on how to choose the ideal model/estimator for each machine learning problem.

## Fit and Predict

[This file](notebooks/3-fit_predict.ipynb) contains some of the ways scikit-learn offers to fit and predict data with chosen estimators.

## Evaluating models

[This file](notebooks/4-evaluating_model.ipynb) contains information on how, once a it's chosen, a model can be evaluated.

## Improving model

[This file](notebooks/5-improving_model.ipynb) contains information on how to improve a model, by tuning their hyperparameters, or even improving the data.

## Saving and loading model

[This file](notebooks/6-saving_loading_model.ipynb) shows some of the best tools for saving and loading models once they have been trained.

## Putting it all together

[This file](notebooks/7-all_together.ipynb) much like the first one contains a workflow of scikit-learn, but this time using `Pipeline`.

## Scikit-learn practice

[This file](notebooks/scikit-learn_practice.ipynb) are some exercises for practising the topics covered in this folder.
