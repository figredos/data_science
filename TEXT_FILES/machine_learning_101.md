## What is machine learning?

Machines can perform tasks for us, this is what programming means

There are many ways of building programs to solve problems, such as calculating routes, or even playing chess by simply using logical statements. This is very counterproductive, and ineffective when it comes to more complex problems, such as, how do I make a computer know when a person is angry? How can angry be explained? Or how to ask a computer if there is a cat in the picture? Same problem arises, how does one explain a cat to a computer? The logical route is to analyze specific characteristics of a cat, such as it's fur, or whiskers, but then again, how can fur or whiskers be explained to a computer?

Machine learning makes these tasks possible, not always perfect, but most cases, these features can be detected by computers through machine learning. The idea behind machine learning is to make machines smarted, because the smarter the machine, the most help it can be to identify and analyze situations human-like.

Using machines to predict results based on incoming data

General term for when computers learn from data.

## AI/Machine learning/Data Science

It all starts with AI (artificial intelligence), which means a human intelligence exhibited by a machine. AI is a machine that acts like a human, and there are two types of AI.

Narrow AIs are AIs that are better than humans at specific tasks, such as identifying heart decease from images, or a game of GO, chess, StarCraft, ect. The problem of Narrow AI is that these machines can do only this one thing really well.

General AIs are AIs that can do more than a single thing

Machine Learning is a subset of AI, it's an approach to try and achieve artificial intelligence through systems that can find patterns in set of data. Stanford University defines Machine Learning as 'the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed'. That is, machines doing things without us saying do this, do that, if that, if this.

Deep Learning is a technique of implementing Machine Learning.

The role of a Data Science, and a Machine Learning expert is quite overlapping. Most jobs don't have a distinction between a machine leaning expert and a data scientist. The field of Data science simply means analyzing data, looking at data and doing something with it, usually relating to business. A Machine learning expert and a data scientist need to know each others fields to do their jobs. One is not doable without the other.
