# Numpy

Numpy (Numerical Python), is a fundamental open-source python library for working with numerical data. It provides a powerful and efficient multidimensional array object, along with a collection of high-level functions to operate on these arrays.

This is one of the most popular libraries when it comes to Data Science and Machine Learning. There are two main reasons why this library is so popular when it comes to these fields, firstly, many of the functionalities offered by numpy are written in C, making them much faster that python. Secondly, the fact that numpy deals with numbers makes it easier to turn the data into numbers and then manage these numbers.
